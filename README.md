# BeAware3000

BeAware3000 was a prototype designed as part of a group project in the course "Designing Interactions" at the IT Univesity of copenhagen.

**Description**

BeAware3000 leverages the wasted time caused by metro-delays, turning ‘waiting-time’ into a given moment, that otherwise would have been missed. The sim is, to turn the attention of the user outwards and become aware of one’s surroundings.
